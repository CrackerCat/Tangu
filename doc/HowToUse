If you want to make solution files as other samples, it must be done to link the header files, to load valid library(.lib) files first as follows.  

1. Add header directories.
Go to [Property Pages] - [Configuration Properties] - [VC++ Directories]
In `Include Directories` tab, add new line and fill these paths.

$(SolutionDir)..\..\tangu\
$(SolutionDir)..\..\tangu\winpcap\

2. Add library directories.
Go to [Property Pages] - [Configuration Properties] - [VC++ Directories]
In `Library Directories` tab, add new line and fill these paths.

$(SolutionDir)..\..\lib\x86\
$(SolutionDir)..\..\tangu\winpcap\x86\
$(SolutionDir)..\..\tangu\windivert\x86\

3. Include header files with #include indicator you are to use.

4. Import library with #pragma indicator.
#pragma comment(lib, "tangu.lib")

5. Write sources, and build them.

6. Excute applications with dlls.
tangu.dll
WinDivert.dll
